    <p align="center">Aggregate and broadcast SSL certs as they're issued live.</p>
</p>

**Certstream-server** is a service written in elixir to aggregate, parse, and stream certificate data from multiple [certificate transparency logs](https://www.certificate-transparency.org/what-is-ct). It leverages the amazing power of elixir/erlang to achieve great network throughput and concurrency with very little resource usage.

This is a rewrite of the [original version written in python](https://github.com/CaliDog/certstream-server-python), and is much more efficient than the original and currently ships millions of certificates a day on a single Hetzner dedicated server without issue (\~250TB of data every month!).

## Getting Started

Getting up and running is pretty easy (especially if you use Heroku, as we include a Dockerfile!).

First install elixir (assuming you're on OSX, otherwise follow [instructions for your platform](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html))

```
$ brew install elixir
```

Then fetch the dependencies

```
$ mix deps.get
```

From there you can run it

```
$ mix run --no-halt
```

Alternatively, you can run it in an iex session (so you can interact with it while it's running) for development

```
$ iex -S mix
Interactive Elixir (1.8.2) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(1)> :observer.start
```

This will open up an http/websocket server on port 4000 (override this by setting a `PORT` environment variable). 

## Usage

Once you have the server runing on some port, you can visit the server to be greeted with the index page. 

If you point a websocket client at the root URL (`/`), it'll give you a data structure that doesn't bundle the DER-encoded certificate.

If you want the certificate data as well, you can point a websocket client to `/full-stream` and it'll also bundle the DER-encoded certificate along with each certificate. 

## Internals

The structure of the application is pretty simple. The dataflow basically looks like this:

```
               CertificateBuffer
                      |
HTTP Watcher \        |        / Websocket Connection Process
HTTP Watcher  - ClientManager -  Websocket Connection Process
HTTP Watcher /                 \ Websocket Connection Process

```
### HTTP Watchers
First we spin up 1 process for every entry in the [known CTL list from the CT project](https://www.gstatic.com/ct/log_list/v3/all_logs_list.json), with each of them being responsible for sleeping for 10 seconds and checking to see if the top of the merkle tree has changed. Once a difference has been found, they go out and download the certificate data, parsing it and coercing it to a hashmap structure using [the EasySSL library](https://github.com/CaliDog/EasySSL) and sending it to the ClientManager.

### ClientManager
This agent is responsible for brokering communication between the CT watchers and the currently connected websocket clients. Certificates are broadcast to websocket connection processes through an erlang [pobox](https://github.com/ferd/pobox) in order to properly load-shed when a slow client isn't reading certificates fast enough. The ClientManager also sends a copy of every certificate received to the CertificateBuffer.

### CertificateBuffer
This agent is responsible for keeping a ring-buffer in memory of the most recently seen 25 certificates, as well as counting the certificates processed by Certstream.

### Websocket Connection Process
Under the hood we use the erlang library [Cowboy](https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy) to handle static content serving, the json APIs, and websocket connections. There's nothing too special about them other than they're assigned a paired pobox at the start of every connection.

## HTTP Routes

`/latest.json` - Get the most recent 25 certificates CertStream has seen

`/example.json` - Get the most recent certificate CertStream has seen
